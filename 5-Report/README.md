Customer information centers at the railway stations are unable to serve such queries at peak periods . The number of the reservation counters available to the passengers and customers are very less . On most of the reservation systems there are long queues , so it takes along time for any individual to book the ticket . As now there are no call centers facilities available to solve the queries of the passengers .The online railway ticket reservation system aims to develop a web application which aims at providing trains details , trains availability , as well as the facility to book ticket in online for customers .
